# Data Structures and Algorithms Visualization Application
This application is a final year project created for a student, designed to visualize various data structures and algorithms. It aims to provide an interactive way to understand how different algorithms work, including sorting algorithms like bubble sort and merge sort, and basic operations on data structures such as arrays, queues, stacks, and trees.
Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and ReactJS

## Features
- Sorting Algorithms Visualization: Demonstrates how sorting algorithms like bubble sort, merge sort, and more operate on data.
- Data Structures: Visualizes basic data structures including arrays, queues, stacks, and trees.
- Algorithm Operations: Implements operations such as counting, finding maximum and minimum, summing, and searching within data structures.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: Markup language for creating the basic structure of the application.
- React: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- Vanilla JavaScript: Core JavaScript used to handle algorithm logic and DOM manipulation.

### How to run the application: 
1. Run npm install in the terminal of the project home directory to install all the necessary dependencies
2. Run npm start to run the app
